Files embedding.py and fjd_metric both come from https://github.com/facebookresearch/fjd, the repository from the original paper. msssim.py comes from tensorflow core. clvrai_implementation.ipynb is adapted from https://github.com/clvrai/ACGAN-PyTorch, and was used to train an outside (not implemented by me) model so that inception score could be calculated.

Results are generated by running original_model.pynb and new_model.ipynb to generate the original architecture and the deeper architecture, respectively. Models and data get saved in original_model and new_model for each model respectively. evaluation.ipynb calculates the fjd, fid, ms-ssim, and inception score for each model.
